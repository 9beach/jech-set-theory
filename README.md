# A solutions manual for Set Theory by Thomas Jech

In December 2017, for no special reason I started studying mathematics and 
writing a solutions manual for [Set Theory by Thomas Jech](https://www.amazon.com/Set-Theory-Thomas-Jech/dp/3540440852).

_GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/9beach/jech-set-theory-solutions),
HTML versions [here](https://rawgit.com/9beach/jech-set-theory-solutions/master/README.html), and PDF version [here](https://github.com/9beach/jech-set-theory-solutions/releases)._
